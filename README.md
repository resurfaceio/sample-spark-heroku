Sample Spark Framework app for Heroku

This was cloned from Heroku's [Getting Started with Java on Heroku](https://github.com/heroku/java-getting-started) app at commit `cf7fb1b`. We originally created this copy when Heroku switched their implementation from Spark Framework to Spring Boot, but we still needed to be able to test under Spark.
